        "\n",
        "Natural language analysis techniques consist of lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)** is an instance of **Shallow Semantic Analysis**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a sentence, a **predicate** states a property or a characterization of a *subject*, such as what it does and what it is like. The predicate represents the core of an event, whereas the words accompanying the predicate are **arguments**. A **semantic role** refers to the abstract role an argument of a predicate take on in the event, including *agent*, *patient*, *theme*, *experiencer*, *beneficiary*, *instrument*, *location*, *goal*, and *source*.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following example of a Chinese sentence, \"to encounter\" is the predicate (*pred*); \"Ming\" is the *agent*; \"Hong\" is the *patient*; \"yesterday\" and \"evening\" are the *time*; finally, \"the park\" is the *location*.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mbox{[小明 Ming]}_{\\mbox{Agent}}\\mbox{[昨天 yesterday]}_{\\mbox{Time}}\\mbox{[晚上 evening]}_\\mbox{Time}\\mbox{在[公园 a park]}_{\\mbox{Location}}\\mbox{[遇到 to encounter]}_{\\mbox{Predicate}}\\mbox{了[小红 Hong]}_{\\mbox{Patient}}\\mbox{。}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of analyzing the semantic information, **Semantic Role Labeling** (**SRL**) identifies the relationship between the predicate and the other constituents surrounding it. The predicate-argument structures are labeled as specific semantic roles. A wide range of natural language understanding tasks, including *information extraction*, *discourse analysis*, and *deepQA*. Research usually assumes a predicate of a sentence to be specified; the only task is to identify its arguments and their semantic roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conventional SRL systems mostly build on top of syntactic analysis, usually consisting of five steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Construct a syntax tree, as shown in Fig. 1\n",
        "2. Identity the candidate arguments of the given predicate on the tree.\n",
        "3. Prune the most unlikely candidate arguments.\n",
        "4. Identify the real arguments, often by a binary classifier.\n",
        "5. Multi-classify on results from step 4 to label the semantic roles. Steps 2 and 3 usually introduce hand-designed features based on syntactic analysis (step 1).\n",

        "However, a complete syntactic analysis requires identifying the relationship among all constituents. Thus, the accuracy of SRL is sensitive to the preciseness of the syntactic analysis, making SRL challenging. To reduce its complexity and obtain some information on the syntactic structures, we often use *shallow syntactic analysis* a.k.a. partial parsing or chunking. Unlike complete syntactic analysis, which requires the construction of the complete parsing tree, *Shallow Syntactic Analysis* only requires identifying some independent constituents with relatively simple structures, such as verb phrases (chunk). To avoid difficulties in constructing a syntax tree with high accuracy, some work\\[[1](#reference)\\] proposed semantic chunking-based SRL methods, which reduces SRL into a sequence tagging problem. Sequence tagging tasks classify syntactic chunks using **BIO representation**. For syntactic chunks forming role A, its first chunk receives the B-A tag (Begin) and the remaining ones receive the tag I-A (Inside); in the end, the chunks left out will receive the tag O.\n",

        "2. Pruning the candidate arguments is no longer necessary;\n",
        "3. Arguments are identified and tagged at the same time. Simplifying the workflow reduces the risk of accumulating errors; oftentimes, methods that unify multiple steps boost performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, our SRL system is built as an end-to-end system via a neural network. The system takes only text sequences as input, without using any syntactic parsing results or complex hand-designed features. The public dataset [CoNLL-2004 and CoNLL-2005 Shared Tasks](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~srlconll/) is used for the following task: given a sentence with predicates marked, identify the corresponding arguments and their semantic roles through sequence tagging.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Recurrent Neural Networks** (*RNN*) are important tools for sequence modeling and have been successfully used in some natural language processing tasks. Unlike feed-forward neural networks, RNNs can model the dependencies between elements of sequences. As a variant of RNNs', LSTMs aim modeling long-term dependency in long sequences. We have introduced this in [understand_sentiment](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/05.understand_sentiment). In this chapter, we continue to use LSTMs to solve SRL problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stacked Recurrent Neural Network\n",
        "\n",
        "*Deep Neural Networks* can extract hierarchical representations. The higher layers can form relatively abstract/complex representations, based on primitive features discovered through the lower layers. Unfolding LSTMs through time results in a deep feed-forward neural network. This is because any computational path between the input at time $k \u003c t$ to the output at time $t$ crosses several nonlinear layers. On the other hand, due to parameter sharing over time, LSTMs are also *shallow*; that is, the computation carried out at each time-step is just a linear transformation. Deep LSTM networks are typically constructed by stacking multiple LSTM layers on top of each other and taking the output from lower LSTM layer at time $t$ as the input of upper LSTM layer at time $t$. Deep, hierarchical neural networks can be efficient at representing some functions and modeling varying-length dependencies\\[[2](#reference)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in a deep LSTM network, any gradient propagated back in depth needs to traverse a large number of nonlinear steps. As a result, while LSTMs of 4 layers can be trained properly, those with 4-8 have much worse performance. Conventional LSTMs prevent back-propagated errors from vanishing or exploding by introducing shortcut connections to skip the intermediate nonlinear layers. Therefore, deep LSTMs can consider shortcut connections in depth as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A single LSTM cell has three operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. input-to-hidden: map input $x$ to the input of the forget gates, input gates, memory cells and output gates by linear transformation (i.e., matrix mapping);\n",
        "2. hidden-to-hidden: calculate forget gates, input gates, output gates and update memory cell, this is the main part of LSTMs;\n",
        "3. hidden-to-output: this part typically involves an activation operation on hidden states.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the stacked LSTMs, we add shortcut connections: take the input-to-hidden from the previous layer as a new input and learn another linear transformation.\n",

        "\n",
        "To address this, we can design a bidirectional recurrent neural network by making a minor modification. A higher LSTM layer can process the sequence in reversed direction with regards to its immediate lower LSTM layer, i.e., deep LSTM layers take turns to train on input sequences from left-to-right and right-to-left. Therefore, LSTM layers at time-step $t$ can see both histories and the future, starting from the second layer. Fig. 4 illustrates the bidirectional recurrent neural networks.\n",

In SRL tasks, a **Conditional Random Field** (*CRF*) is built on top of the network in order to perform the final prediction to tag sequences. It takes representations provided by the last LSTM layer as input.\n",

In addition, $\\lambda_j$ and $\\mu_k$ are weights corresponding to $t_j$ and $s_k$. Alternatively, $t$ and $s$ can be written in the same form that depends on $y_{i - 1}$, $y_i$, $X$, and $i$. Taking its summation over all nodes $i$, we have: $f_{k}(Y, X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_k({y_{i - 1}, y_i, X, i})$, which defines the *feature function* $f$. Thus, $P(Y|X)$ can be written as:\n",

        "\n",
        "Semantic Role Labeling is an important intermediate step in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. In this tutorial, we use SRL as an example to illustrate using PaddlePaddle to do sequence tagging tasks. The models proposed are from our published paper\\[[10](#Reference)\\]. We only use test data for illustration since the training data on the CoNLL 2005 dataset is not completely public. This aims to propose an end-to-end neural network model with fewer dependencies on natural language processing tools but is comparable, or even better than traditional models in terms of performance. Please check out our paper for more information and discussions.\n",
