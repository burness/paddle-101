        "- **Flexibility**\n",
        "\n",
        "    PaddlePaddle supports a wide range of neural network architectures and\n",
        "    optimization algorithms. It is easy to configure complex models such as\n",
        "    neural machine translation model with attention mechanism or complex memory\n",
        "    connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Efficiency**\n",
        "\n",
        "    In order to unleash the power of heterogeneous computing resource,\n",
        "    optimization occurs at different levels of PaddlePaddle, including\n",
        "    computing, memory, architecture and communication. The following are some\n",
        "    examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Optimized math operations through SSE/AVX intrinsics, BLAS libraries\n",
        "      (e.g. MKL, ATLAS, cuBLAS) or customized CPU/GPU kernels.\n",
        "      - Highly optimized recurrent networks which can handle **variable-length**\n",
        "      sequence without padding.\n",
        "      - Optimized local and distributed training for models with high dimensional\n",
