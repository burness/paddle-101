        "The source codes of this section is located at [book/understand_sentiment](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/06.understand_sentiment). First-time users may refer to PaddlePaddle for [Installation guide](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/README.md#running-the-book).\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "In natural language processing, sentiment analysis refers to determining the emotion expressed in a piece of text. The text can be a sentence, a paragraph, or a document. Emotion categorization can be binary -- positive/negative or happy/sad -- or in three classes -- positive/neutral/negative. Sentiment analysis is applicable in a wide range of services, such as e-commerce sites like Amazon and Taobao, hospitality services like Airbnb and hotels.com, and movie rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. It can be used to gauge from the reviews how the customers feel about the product. Table 1 illustrates an example of sentiment analysis in movie reviews:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Movie Review       | Category  |\n",
        "| --------     | -----  |\n",
        "| Best movie of Xiaogang Feng in recent years!| Positive |\n",
        "| Pretty bad. Feels like a tv-series from a local TV-channel     | Negative |\n",
        "| Politically correct version of Taken ... and boring as Heck| Negative|\n",
        "|delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected. The plot is nicely designed.|Positive|\n",
        "\n",
        "\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003eTable 1 Sentiment Analysis in Movie Reviews\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "In natural language processing, sentiment analysis can be categorized as a **Text Classification problem**, i.e., to categorize a piece of text to a specific class. It involves two related tasks: text representation and classification. Before the emergence of deep learning techniques, the mainstream methods for text representation include BOW (*bag of words*) and topic modeling, while the latter contains SVM (*support vector machine*) and LR (*logistic regression*).\n",
        "\n",
        "The BOW model does not capture all the information in a piece of text, as it ignores syntax and grammar and just treats the text as a set of words. For example, “this movie is extremely bad“ and “boring, dull, and empty work” describe very similar semantic meaning, yet their BOW representations have very little similarity. Furthermore, “the movie is bad“ and “the movie is not bad“ have high similarity with BOW features, but they express completely opposite semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter introduces a deep learning model that handles these issues in BOW. Our model embeds texts into a low-dimensional space and takes word order into consideration. It is an end-to-end framework and it has large performance improvement over traditional methods \\[[1](#references)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The model we used in this chapter uses **Convolutional Neural Networks** (**CNNs**) and **Recurrent Neural Networks** (**RNNs**) with some specific extensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Revisit to the Convolutional Neural Networks for Texts (CNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "The convolutional neural network for texts is introduced in chapter [recommender_system](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/05.recommender_system), here is a brief overview.\n",
        "\n",
        "CNN mainly contains convolution and pooling operation, with versatile combinations in various applications. We firstly apply the convolution operation: we apply the kernel in each window, extracting features. Convolving by the kernel at every window produces a feature map. Next, we apply *max pooling* over time to represent the whole sentence, which is the maximum element across the feature map. In real applications, we will apply multiple CNN kernels on the sentences. It can be implemented efficiently by concatenating the kernels together as a matrix. Also, we can use CNN kernels with different kernel size. Finally, concatenating the resulting features produces a fixed-length representation, which can be combined with a softmax to form the model for the sentiment analysis problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "For short texts, the aforementioned CNN model can achieve very high accuracy \\[[1](#references)\\]. If we want to extract more abstract representations, we may apply a deeper CNN model \\[[2](#references),[3](#references)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "RNN is an effective model for sequential data. In terms of computability, the RNN is Turing-complete \\[[4](#references)\\]. Since NLP is a classical problem of sequential data, the RNN, especially its variant LSTM\\[[5](#references)\\]), achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, such as language modeling, syntax parsing, POS-tagging, image captioning, dialog, machine translation, and so forth.\n",

        "\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "As shown in Figure 1, we unfold an RNN: at the $t$-th time step, the network takes two inputs: the $t$-th input vector $\\vec{x_t}$ and the latent state from the last time-step $\\vec{h_{t-1}}$. From those, it computes the latent state of the current step $\\vec{h_t}$. This process is repeated until all inputs are consumed. Denoting the RNN as function $f$, it can be formulated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\vec{h_t}=f(\\vec{x_t},\\vec{h_{t-1}})=\\sigma(W_{xh}\\vec{x_t}+W_{hh}\\vec{h_{h-1}}+\\vec{b_h})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $W_{xh}$ is the weight matrix to feed into the latent layer; $W_{hh}$ is the latent-to-latent matrix; $b_h$ is the latent bias and $\\sigma$ refers to the $sigmoid$ function.\n",
        "\n",
        "In NLP, words are often represented as one-hot vectors and then mapped to an embedding. The embedded feature goes through an RNN as input $x_t$ at every time step. Moreover, we can add other layers on top of RNN, such as a deep or stacked RNN. Finally, the last latent state may be used as a feature for sentence classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
        "\n",
        "Training an RNN on long sequential data sometimes leads to the gradient vanishing or exploding\\[[6](#references)\\]. To solve this problem Hochreiter S, Schmidhuber J. (1997) proposed **Long Short Term Memory** (LSTM)\\[[5](#references)\\]).\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to the structure of a simple RNN, an LSTM includes memory cell $c$, input gate $i$, forget gate $f$ and output gate $o$. These gates and memory cells dramatically improve the ability for the network to handle long sequences. We can formulate the **LSTM-RNN**, denoted as a function $F$, as follows：\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ h_t=F(x_t,h_{t-1})$$\n",
        "\n",

The input gate controls the magnitude of the new input into the memory cell $c$; the forget gate controls the memory propagated from the last time step; the output gate controls the magnitutde of the output. The three gates are computed similarly with different parameters, and they influence memory cell $c$ separately, as shown in Figure 2:\n",

We can also apply an RNN with reverse-direction to take successive context $t+1…n$ into consideration. Combining constructing deep RNN (deeper RNN can contain more abstract and higher level semantic), we can design structures with deep stacked bidirectional LSTM to model sequential data\\[[9](#references)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "As shown in Figure 3 (3-layer RNN), odd/even layers are forward/reverse LSTM. Higher layers of LSTM take lower-layers LSTM as input, and the top-layer LSTM produces a fixed length vector by max-pooling (this representation considers contexts from previous and successive words for higher-level abstractions). Finally, we concatenate the output to a softmax layer for classification.\n",

        "In this chapter, we use sentiment analysis as an example to introduce applying deep learning models on end-to-end short text classification, as well as how to use PaddlePaddle to implement the model. Meanwhile, we briefly introduce two models for text processing: CNN and RNN. In following chapters, we will see how these models can be applied in other tasks.\n",
