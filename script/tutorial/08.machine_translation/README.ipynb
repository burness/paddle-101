        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine translation (MT) leverages computers to translate from one language to another. The language to be translated is referred to as the source language, while the language to be translated into is referred to as the target language. Thus, Machine translation is the process of translating from the source language to the target language. It is one of the most important research topics in the field of natural language processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Early machine translation systems are mainly rule-based i.e. they rely on a language expert to specify the translation rules between the two languages. It is quite difficult to cover all the rules used in one language. So it is quite a challenge for language experts to specify all possible rules in two or more different languages. Hence, a major challenge in conventional machine translation has been the difficulty in obtaining a complete rule set \\[[1](#references)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To address the aforementioned problems, statistical machine translation techniques have been developed. These techniques learn the translation rules from a large corpus, instead of being designed by a language expert. While these techniques overcome the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition, there are still quite a lot of challenges, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Human designed features cannot cover all possible linguistic variations;\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It is difficult to use global features;\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The techniques heavily rely on pre-processing techniques like word alignment, word segmentation and tokenization, rule-extraction and syntactic parsing etc. The error introduced in any of these steps could accumulate and impact translation quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The recent development of deep learning provides new solutions to these challenges. The two main categories for deep learning based machine translation techniques are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Techniques based on the statistical machine translation system but with some key components improved with neural networks, e.g., language model, reordering model (please refer to the left part of Figure 1);\n",

        "A GRU unit has only two gates:\n",
        "- reset gate: when this gate is closed, the history information is discarded, i.e., the irrelevant historical information has no effect on the future output.\n",
        "- update gate: it combines the input gate and the forget gate and is used to control the impact of historical information on the hidden output. The historical information is passed over when the update gate is close to 1.\n",

        "### Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network\n",
        "\n",
        "We already introduced an instance of bi-directional RNN in the [Semantic Role Labeling](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/label_semantic_roles/README.md) chapter. Here we present another bi-directional RNN model with a different architecture proposed by Bengio et al. in \\[[2](#references),[4](#references)\\]. This model takes a sequence as input and outputs a fixed dimensional feature vector at each step, encoding the context information at the corresponding time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, this bi-directional RNN processes the input sequence in the original and reverse order respectively, and then concatenates the output feature vectors at each time step as the final output. Thus the output node at each time step contains information from the past and future as context. The figure below shows an unrolled bi-directional RNN. This network contains a forward RNN and backward RNN with six weight matrices: weight matrices from input to forward hidden layer and backward hidden ($W_1, W_3$), weight matrices from hidden to itself ($W_2, W_5$), matrices from forward hidden and backward hidden to output layer ($W_4, W_6$). Note that there are no connections between forward hidden and backward hidden layers.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Encoder-Decoder\\[[2](#references)\\] framework aims to solve the mapping of a sequence to another sequence, for sequences with arbitrary lengths. The source sequence is encoded into a vector via an encoder, which is then decoded to a target sequence via a decoder by maximizing the predictive probability. Both the encoder and the decoder are typically implemented via RNN.\n",

        "\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Encoder\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three steps for encoding a sentence:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. One-hot vector representation of a word: Each word $x_i$ in the source sentence $x=\\left \\{ x_1,x_2,...,x_T \\right \\}$ is represented as a vector $w_i\\epsilon \\left \\{ 0,1 \\right \\}^{\\left | V \\right |},i=1,2,...,T$   where $w_i$ has the same dimensionality as the size of the dictionary, i.e., $\\left | V \\right |$, and has an element of one at the location corresponding to the location of the word in the dictionary and zero elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Word embedding as a representation in the low-dimensional semantic space: There are two problems with one-hot vector representation\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The dimensionality of the vector is typically large, leading to the curse of dimensionality;\n",
        "\n",
        "  * It is hard to capture the relationships between words, i.e., semantic similarities. Therefore, it is useful to project the one-hot vector into a low-dimensional semantic space as a dense vector with fixed dimensions, i.e., $s_i=Cw_i$ for the $i$-th word, with $C\\epsilon R^{K\\times \\left | V \\right |}$ as the projection matrix and $K$ is the dimensionality of the word embedding vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Encoding of the source sequence via RNN: This can be described mathematically as:\n",
        "\n",
        "    $$h_i=\\varnothing _\\theta \\left ( h_{i-1}, s_i \\right )$$\n",
        "\n",
        "    where\n",
        "    $h_0$ is a zero vector,\n",
        "    $\\varnothing _\\theta$ is a non-linear activation function, and\n",
        "    $\\mathbf{h}=\\left \\{ h_1,..., h_T \\right \\}$\n",
        "    is the sequential encoding of the first $T$ words from the source sequence. The vector representation of the whole sentence can be represented as the encoding vector at the last time step $T$ from $\\mathbf{h}$, or by temporal pooling over $\\mathbf{h}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Bi-directional RNN can also be used in step (3) for more a complicated sentence encoding. This can be implemented using a bi-directional GRU. Forward GRU encodes the source sequence in its original order $(x_1,x_2,...,x_T)$, and generates a sequence of hidden states $(\\overrightarrow{h_1},\\overrightarrow{h_2},...,\\overrightarrow{h_T})$. The backward GRU encodes the source sequence in reverse order, i.e., $(x_T,x_T-1,...,x_1)$ and generates $(\\overleftarrow{h_1},\\overleftarrow{h_2},...,\\overleftarrow{h_T})$. Then for each word $x_i$, its complete hidden state is the concatenation of the corresponding hidden states from the two GRUs, i.e., $h_i=\\left [ \\overrightarrow{h_i^T},\\overleftarrow{h_i^T} \\right ]^{T}$.\n",

        "\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Decoder\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the decoder is to maximize the probability of the next correct word in the target language. The main idea is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. At each time step $i$, given the encoding vector (or context vector) $c$ of the source sentence, the $i$-th word $u_i$ from the ground-truth target language and the RNN hidden state $z_i$, the next hidden state $z_{i+1}$ is computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$z_{i+1}=\\phi _{\\theta '}\\left ( c,u_i,z_i \\right )$$\n",
        "   where $\\phi _{\\theta '}$ is a non-linear activation function and $c=q\\mathbf{h}$ is the context vector of the source sentence. Without using [attention](#Attention Mechanism), if the output of the [encoder](#Encoder) is the encoding vector at the last time step of the source sentence, then $c$ can be defined as $c=h_T$. $u_i$ denotes the $i$-th word from the target language sentence and $u_0$ denotes the beginning of the target language sentence (i.e., `\u003cs\u003e`), indicating the beginning of decoding. $z_i$ is the RNN hidden state at time step $i$ and $z_0$ is an all zero vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Calculate the probability $p_{i+1}$ for the $i+1$-th word in the target language sequence by normalizing $z_{i+1}$ using `softmax` as follows\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$p\\left ( u_{i+1}|u_{\u0026lt;i+1},\\mathbf{x} \\right )=softmax(W_sz_{i+1}+b_z)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "   where $W_sz_{i+1}+b_z$ scores each possible words and is then normalized via softmax to produce the probability $p_{i+1}$ for the $i+1$-th word.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Compute the cost accoding to $p_{i+1}$ and $u_{i+1}$.\n",
        "4. Repeat Steps 1-3, until all the words in the target language sentence have been processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The generation process of machine translation is to translate the source sentence into a sentence in the target language according to a pre-trained model. There are some differences between the decoding step in generation and training. Please refer to [Beam Search Algorithm](#Beam Search Algorithm) for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Attention Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few problems with the fixed dimensional vector representation from the encoding stage:\n",
        "  * It is very challenging to encode both the semantic and syntactic information a sentence with a fixed dimensional vector regardless of the length of the sentence.\n",
        "  * Intuitively, when translating a sentence, we typically pay more attention to the parts in the source sentence more relevant to the current translation. Moreover, the focus changes along the process of the translation. With a fixed dimensional vector, all the information from the source sentence is treated equally in terms of attention. This is not reasonable. Therefore, Bahdanau et al. \\[[4](#references)\\] introduced attention mechanism, which can decode based on different fragments of the context sequence in order to address the difficulty of feature learning for long sentences. Decoder with attention will be explained in the following.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different from the simple decoder, $z_i$ is computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$z_{i+1}=\\phi _{\\theta '}\\left ( c_i,u_i,z_i \\right )$$\n",
        "\n",
        "It is observed that for each word $u_i$ in the target language sentence, there is a corresponding context vector $c_i$ as the encoding of the source sentence, which is computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$c_i=\\sum _{j=1}^{T}a_{ij}h_j, a_i=\\left[ a_{i1},a_{i2},...,a_{iT}\\right ]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "It is noted that the attention mechanism is achieved by a weighted average over the RNN hidden states $h_j$. The weight $a_{ij}$ denotes the strength of attention of the $i$-th word in the target language sentence to the $j$-th word in the source sentence and is calculated as\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "a_{ij}\u0026=\\frac{exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{T}exp(e_{ik})}\\\\\\\\\n",
        "e_{ij}\u0026=align(z_i,h_j)\\\\\\\\\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "where $align$ is an alignment model that measures the fitness between the $i$-th word in the target language sentence and the $j$-th word in the source sentence. More concretely, the fitness is computed with the $i$-th hidden state $z_i$ of the decoder RNN and the $j$-th context vector $h_j$ of the source sentence. Hard alignment is used in the conventional alignment model, which means each word in the target language explicitly corresponds to one or more words from the target language sentence. In an attention model, soft alignment is used, where any word in source sentence is related to any word in the target language sentence, where the strength of the relation is a real number computed via the model, thus can be incorporated into the NMT framework and can be trained via back-propagation.\n",

        "### Beam Search Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "[Beam Search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. It is typically used when the solution space is huge  (e.g., for machine translation, speech recognition), and there is not enough memory for all the possible solutions. For example, if we want to translate “`\u003cs\u003e你好\u003ce\u003e`” into English, even if there are only three words in the dictionary (`\u003cs\u003e`, `\u003ce\u003e`, `hello`), it is still possible to generate an infinite number of sentences, where the word `hello` can appear different number of times. Beam search could be used to find a good translation among them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beam search builds a search tree using breadth first search and sorts the nodes according to a heuristic cost (sum of the log probability of the generated words) at each level of the tree. Only a fixed number of nodes according to the pre-specified beam size (or beam width) are considered. Thus, only nodes with highest scores are expanded in the next level. This reduces the space and time requirements significantly. However, a globally optimal solution is not guaranteed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to maximize the probability of the generated sequence when using beam search in decoding, The procedure is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. At each time step $i$, compute the hidden state $z_{i+1}$ of the next time step according to the context vector $c$ of the source sentence, the $i$-th word $u_i$ generated for the target language sentence and the RNN hidden state $z_i$.\n",
        "2. Normalize $z_{i+1}$ using `softmax` to get the probability $p_{i+1}$ for the $i+1$-th word for the target language sentence.\n",
        "3. Sample the word $u_{i+1}$ according to $p_{i+1}$.\n",
        "4. Repeat Steps 1-3, until end-of-sentence token `\u003ce\u003e` is generated or the maximum length of the sentence is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: $z_{i+1}$ and $p_{i+1}$ are computed the same way as in [Decoder](#Decoder). In generation mode, each step is greedy in so there is no guarantee of a global optimum.\n",
